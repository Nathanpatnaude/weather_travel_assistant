## Decription

This is a javascript application that uses OpenWeatherApi to provide the user with both the current weather, and the forecast of the next five days.

The results are obtained when the user inputs either a zipCode or a CityName into the input field and clicks submit. 

The application uses local storage to provide the user with a shortcut list of recent searches, which can be individually deleted.

The user may also choose between F and C unit types, and they may set a home location from a list of previous searches to run on pageload. These settings also persist in localStorage.
