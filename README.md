## Decription

This is a javascript application that uses OpenWeatherApi to provide the user with both the current weather, and the forecast of the next five days. The results are obtained when the user inputs either a zipCode or a CityName into the input field and clicks submit. The application uses local storage to provide the user with a shortcut list of recent searches, which can also be individually deleted.
